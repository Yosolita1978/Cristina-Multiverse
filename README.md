## Frontend - ⚡ React & Vite
### Notes:
- **Requirements:** React requires **Node >= 14.0.0** & **npm >= 5.6**
- This template uses icons from `react-icons/io5` and `react-bootstrap`. Check dependencies in **package.json** inside the `client` folder.
- The **backend server runs on port 8080**, and the **React frontend runs on port 5173** (default Vite port).
- Confused about **why use Vite?** → [Check out this guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
